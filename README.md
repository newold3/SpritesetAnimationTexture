# SpritesetAnimationTexture
A Godot addon that converts SpriteFrames animations into usable Texture2D resources. Use animated sprites anywhere textures are accepted—UI elements, materials, shaders, draw calls, and nested within other animated textures. Plug-and-play: simply drop it into your project and it works immediately.

🟢 Features

Universal Texture Support: Use animated sprites anywhere Texture2D is accepted (Sprite2D, TextureRect, Button icons, materials, shaders, etc.)
Nested Animations: Stack animated textures inside other animated textures up to 7 levels deep for complex visual effects
Editor & Runtime: Seamless functionality in both the Godot editor and at runtime
Automatic Synchronization: Handles frame updates, caching, and rendering across all instances automatically
Zero Configuration: No plugin activation needed—just add to your project
Memory Efficient: Automatic cleanup of orphaned references and intelligent caching
Performance Optimized: Hibernation mode for off-screen animations, stack depth protection against infinite loops

🟢 Installation

Download or clone this addon into your project's addons/ folder:

   your_project/
   └── addons/
       └── AnimateTexture/
           ├── plugin.cfg
           └── spriteset_animation_texture.gd

That's it. No plugin activation needed—SpritesetAnimationTexture is immediately available as an export option in any texture property across your entire project.

🟢 Quick Start
Basic Usage (Code)
gdscript# Create and configure
var animated_texture = SpritesetAnimationTexture.new()
animated_texture.sprite_frames = preload("res://animations/player.tres")
animated_texture.animation = "idle"
animated_texture.playing = true

# Use anywhere a texture is needed
$Sprite2D.texture = animated_texture
$TextureRect.texture = animated_texture
$Button.icon = animated_texture
Using the Inspector

Select any node with a texture export (Sprite2D, TextureRect, Panel, etc.)
In the Inspector, find the texture property
Create a new resource → choose SpritesetAnimationTexture
Assign your SpriteFrames resource
Select the animation name to play
Adjust speed_scale if needed (default: 1.0)
Check autoplay to start automatically

Nested Animations
gdscript# Inner animation layer
var sparkle = SpritesetAnimationTexture.new()
sparkle.sprite_frames = preload("res://animations/sparkle.tres")
sparkle.animation = "twinkle"

# Outer animation that uses inner animation as frames
var magic_effect = SpritesetAnimationTexture.new()
magic_effect.sprite_frames = preload("res://animations/magic.tres")
magic_effect.animation = "cast"

# The magic effect animation will now display the sparkle animation
# as its frame sequence, creating a composite animation effect
$Effect.texture = magic_effect
Supports up to 7 levels of nesting for complex visual compositions.

# Stop playback
stop() -> void

# Manually set the current frame
set_frame(frame: int) -> void

# Get the current frame index
get_frame() -> int

# Get total frame count for the current animation
get_frame_count() -> int

# Get the current animation name
get_animation() -> String

# Check if animation is currently playing
is_playing() -> bool

# Reset animation to first frame and current state
reset() -> void
🟢 Use Cases
Game Development

Character animations: Walk, run, idle, attack, death animations on sprites
Visual effects: Explosions, magic spells, particle effects
UI animations: Pulsing buttons, loading spinners, status indicators
Game elements: Collectibles, environmental effects, enemy animations

UI/UX

Animated buttons: Glowing effects, hover animations
Loading states: Spinners, progress indicators
Status displays: Blinking alerts, pulsing status icons
Transitions: Animated screen overlays, visual feedback

Advanced

Layered effects: Combine multiple animated textures for complex visuals
Shader support: Use animated textures in material shaders
Dynamic scenes: Change animations based on game state
Performance optimization: Control animation playback based on visibility

🟢 Performance Considerations

Caching System: Textures are cached to minimize lookups and improve frame rate
Hibernation Mode: Animations automatically pause when nodes are deleted or the texture is unused, reducing memory and CPU overhead
Stack Depth Protection: Recursive nesting is limited to 7 levels to prevent infinite loops (max stack depth: 8)
Automatic Cleanup: Dead references are cleaned up periodically to prevent memory leaks
Efficient Synchronization: Updates are batched and synchronized with the rendering pipeline

Tips for Best Performance

Stop unused animations: Set playing = false for off-screen textures
Preload SpriteFrames: Use preload() instead of load() for zero-delay initialization
Cache instances: Reuse animated texture instances instead of creating new ones repeatedly
Monitor frame rate: Very complex nested animations on many sprites may impact performance—profile your specific use case

🟢 Advanced Features
Frame-by-Frame Control
gdscript# Manually control frame display without autoplay
anim_tex.playing = false
anim_tex.set_frame(5)  # Jump to frame 5
anim_tex.set_frame((anim_tex.current_frame + 1) % anim_tex.get_frame_count())  # Next frame
Dynamic Speed Control
gdscript# Speed up or slow down playback in real-time
anim_tex.speed_scale = 0.5   # Half speed
anim_tex.speed_scale = 2.0   # Double speed
anim_tex.speed_scale = 0.1   # Very slow motion
Animation State Synchronization
gdscript# Respond to animation events
anim_tex.frame_changed.connect(func():
	print("Frame: ", anim_tex.current_frame)
)

anim_tex.animation_finished.connect(func(anim_name: String):
	print("Animation '%s' finished" % anim_name)
	anim_tex.animation = "next_animation"
)
Composite Animations
gdscript# Layer multiple animated textures for complex effects
var background = SpritesetAnimationTexture.new()
background.sprite_frames = preload("res://animations/bg.tres")
background.animation = "scroll"

var foreground = SpritesetAnimationTexture.new()
foreground.sprite_frames = preload("res://animations/fg.tres")
foreground.animation = "parallax"

$Background.texture = background
$Foreground.texture = foreground
🟢 Editor Support

Live Preview: Changes to properties update instantly in the editor viewport
Animation Selection: Dropdown menu automatically populated from SpriteFrames animations
Real-time Updates: Modify animations while the scene is running and see changes instantly
Property Validation: Invalid animation names are automatically corrected
Nested Texture Support: The editor properly handles and displays nested animated textures

🔴 Limitations & Notes

Requires SpriteFrames: An animated texture must have a valid SpriteFrames resource assigned
Single Animation: Only one animation can play at a time (assign different textures to different nodes for parallel animations)
Nesting Depth: Maximum 7 levels of nested animations to prevent infinite loops
Tested on Latest Godot: This addon is tested on the latest stable version of Godot

🟢 Troubleshooting
Texture doesn't appear?

✅ Verify sprite_frames is assigned
✅ Check that animation name exists in the SpriteFrames resource
✅ Confirm playing is set to true
✅ Check the node is visible in the scene tree

Animation not updating?

✅ Ensure sprite_frames is a valid, loaded resource
✅ Verify the animation loop/duration settings in SpriteFrames
✅ Try calling reset() to reinitialize the animation state

Performance issues?

✅ Reduce the number of simultaneous animated textures
✅ Lower animation speed with speed_scale
✅ Stop animations for off-screen elements
✅ Use simpler sprite atlases with fewer frames

Nested textures not working?

✅ Ensure inner texture is a valid SpritesetAnimationTexture
✅ Check that inner texture has sprite_frames assigned
✅ Verify nesting depth is 7 levels or less
✅ Confirm inner animation names are valid

🟢 Architecture Notes
This addon is highly optimized with strict internal ordering requirements:

Variable positions and function call sequences are critical
State synchronization between editor and runtime is precise
The stack depth protection prevents infinite recursion
Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks

Do not modify internal implementation details without thorough testing. Use the public API and properties for customization.
