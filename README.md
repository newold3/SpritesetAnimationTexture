# SpritesetAnimationTexture
A Godot addon that converts SpriteFrames animations into usable Texture2D resources. Use animated sprites anywhere textures are accepted—UI elements, materials, shaders, draw calls, and nested within other animated textures. Plug-and-play: simply drop it into your project and it works immediately.
